# Regression pin for the RESOURCE-MUTATION AUDIT LOG extension.
#
# WHAT THIS CLOSES. DockPanel already had two logging paths: `activity::
# log_activity(...)`, which writes to the MUTABLE `activity_logs` table (no
# trigger stops an UPDATE/DELETE on it), and `security_hardening::audit_log
# (...)`, which writes to the IMMUTABLE `security_audit_log` table (a Postgres
# trigger blocks UPDATE/DELETE on it) plus an append-only tamper-resistant
# file. Before this change, audit_log was only ever called from auth.rs,
# security.rs, git_deploys.rs, passkeys.rs and services/auto_healer.rs — every
# OTHER destructive or privilege-sensitive action (deleting a site or server,
# promoting/demoting a reseller, resetting another user's password or 2FA,
# rotating a secret or server token, disabling SSH password auth, etc.) only
# ever reached the mutable table. DockPanel supports teams/resellers/multiple
# admins, so a compromised admin account or a malicious insider could perform
# one of those actions and then edit or delete the activity_logs row that
# recorded it, leaving zero forensic trace.
#
# THE FIX. 96 call sites across 32 route files were classified (a 7-agent
# survey over every activity::log_activity(...)/log_activity_on_server(...)
# call in panel/backend/src/routes) as destructive, privilege-changing,
# credential-lifecycle, or infrastructure-topology mutations, and each now
# ALSO writes an immutable audit_log() entry alongside its existing
# log_activity() call — same actor, same target, same details, reusing the
# real caller IP wherever `headers: HeaderMap` could be threaded through
# (adding that parameter to 81 handlers that didn't already have it). A live
# smoke test against this box's real Postgres during development found a
# 97th site the survey's grep pattern couldn't see: auth.rs's login handler
# has a THIRD logging variant, log_activity_system(...), on the "no such
# account" branch — the one call in the whole codebase that uses it, and (per
# its own comment) "the branch that matters for detection", since credential
# stuffing and username enumeration are attempts against emails that don't
# exist. Fixed and added to this pin (§3) as its own targeted assertion,
# distinct from the sibling "wrong password for a real account" branch.
# Ship any of this without a per-site pin and a single reverted call site (or
# a severity silently downgraded from "critical" to "warning" on something
# like site.delete) is invisible until an incident review goes looking for a
# trail that was never guaranteed to survive.
#
# Pure source analysis: no box, no network, no build, no Docker/Postgres.

# ── 3. Targeted content checks — the highest-value / trickiest sites ───

# sites where the real caller IP was sitting right there and had to be wired
# in, not left as None).

# boolean grep — a `producer | grep -q` under `set -o pipefail` reads a
# successful early-exit match as a failure the moment grep stops reading
# before the producer finishes writing, the exact SIGPIPE-false-negative
# class this project's own pipefail-sigpipe-pin-e2e.sh exists to catch).
# Whitespace is stripped from both the haystack and every needle below so
# formatting (single-line vs multi-line calls) can't cause a false miss.
