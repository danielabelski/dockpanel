# Regression pin for PER-SITE SFTP ACCOUNTS (GH #108).
#
# Real Linux system accounts, a real chroot jail, and a real sshd config
# change — the highest-blast-radius thing this codebase has ever generated on
# its own. The invariants this suite exists to protect:
#
#   - uid/gid allocation goes through a real Postgres SEQUENCE (nextval()),
#     never a MAX(sftp_uid)+1 read — the latter races under two concurrent
#     enables (both can read the same MAX before either commits)
#   - the sshd drop-in is written, validated (`sshd -t`), and RELOADED —
#     never the existing SSH-hardening code's bare `restart_sshd` with no
#     validation, which would risk locking out SSH on a bad Match block
#   - the SFTP password is never piped through stdin or handled by extending
#     the shared `UnsandboxedCommand` primitive — it's hashed in-process
#     (`sha-crypt`) and set via `usermod -p <hash>`, so the plaintext never
#     needs infrastructure this codebase doesn't already have
#   - teardown never deletes a Linux account without first proving (via the
#     owner marker) that the uid actually belongs to the domain being torn
#     down — the same fail-closed shape as every other `owned_*` check
#   - the real site directory is never moved — only bind-mounted into the
#     jail and chowned in place — so no nginx/PHP-FPM/WP-CLI/CMS-installer
#     path anywhere else in the codebase had to change
#   - the backend's `pool_user`/`pool_group` naming convention and the
#     agent's `sftp_username`/`sftp_groupname` functions that actually create
#     the accounts must produce byte-identical names — they are two separate
#     binaries, so nothing but this pin catches a drift between them
#   - no password is ever persisted anywhere in the schema
#
# Pure source analysis: no box, no network, no DB, no real Linux accounts.
